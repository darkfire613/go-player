Fuck the legalese and fuck the current copyright system. If you found this code, and if you think it can be useful to you in any way, go for it.  I don't care. I'm pursuing this project as nothing more than a work of passion, driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. I don't care about profit, I don't care about recognition. All I ask is that if you happen to use anything you find here, consider adding this same "license" to your work. It will help make the world a better place. I give this software to you, my reader, and to anyone else who may stumble upon it.
