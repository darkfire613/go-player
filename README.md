go-player
=========

An attempt at creating a learning Go-playing algorithm.

Right now, all the program is draw an empty board to the terminal. An empty board is represented by an x by y array of plusses, looking something like the following:

```
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
```

To get this yourself, do the following (OSX and Linux):

1. Fork this repo and pull it to your computer.
2. From Terminal, cd into the directory and type: ```make```
3. run the program by typing: ```bin/boardTest```
4. You should see something similar to above. Modifying the x and y values in boardtest.cpp to change the dimension of the board.
5. type ```make clean``` to delete all the files generated by the makefile.
