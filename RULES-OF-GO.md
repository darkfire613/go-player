RULES OF GO
===========
Adapted from "Official AGA Rules of Go" found at:  http://www.usgo.org/files/pdf/completerules.pdf

1. The Board and Stones: Go is played by two sides typically on a 19x19 grid called the **board**. The game can also be played on other sizes. 13x13 and 9x9 are common. The two sides, **Black** and **White** are each provided an adequate supply of playing tokens, known as **stones**, of the appropriate color.

2. Play: The players alternate turns, with black playing first. In handicap games, white moves first after black has played handicaps. a **move** consists of either playing a stone of one's color on an empty intersection (including edges and corners), or passing. Certain moves are illegal (Rules 5 & 6) but passing is always legal (Rule 7). **Points** are awarded for controlling space (Rule 12). The object of the game is to end with the greater total number of points.

3. Compensation: In an even (non-handicap) game, Black gives White a compensation of 7 1/2 points for the advantage of first move. This compensation is added to White's score at the end of the game. In handicap games, Black gives White 1/2 point compensation. This avoids draws.

4. Handicaps: The game may be played with a **handicap** to compensate for differences in player strength. The weaker player takes Black, and either moves first, giving 1/2 point compensation to White (this is known as a "one stone handicap"), or places from 2 to 9 stones on the board before the first White move. If area counting is used to score, White receives an additional point for each Black handicap stone after the first. Handicap stones are placed according to offical AGA rules (see link above).

5. Capture: Stones are **connected** if they are adjacent along horizontal or vertical lines on the board. A string of connected stones consists of those stones which can be reached from a given stone by moving only to adjacent stones of the same color. A string is **surrounded** by stones of the opposite color if it has no empty points adjacent to any of its member stones. Such adjacent empty points are known as **liberties**.
